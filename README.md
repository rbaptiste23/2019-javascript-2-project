##Work on the open issues for the project in github

#issue 1
##Bug! Currently the age and sex filter is not being respected by the cli. Figure out why, then update the code to properly filter letters by those prompts

#issue 2
##Feature! We want to be able to make letters that would go inside the envelopes. Take your previous letter work, and implement another program similar to envelope for letters


#Remember between each session of working on the project that you should:
##when stopping work: ctrl c the server, commit and push changes to github
##when starting, run the server, and then in a separate window, test your cli app
